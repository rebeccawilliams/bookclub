Civic Tech Book Club is a virtual book club that meets sporadically to discuss readings related to civics and technology. The group was created in 2015 by [Rebecca Ackerman](https://github.com/rcackerman), [Forest Gregg](https://github.com/fgregg), and [Rebecca Williams](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams) who lived far apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss readings. Since the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new life and meets more frequently. The membership generally skews a bit more "civics" in background than "technology" and expands via word of mouth but all are welcome. Texts for discussion are organized through the listserv with members joining virtually and informally at their convenience. Meetings are usually 3-6 people, but there are have been surges. This website keeps an archive of readings for the group's organization and in case it is helpful to others.
