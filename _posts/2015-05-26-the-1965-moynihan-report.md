**Reading: [The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (the 1965 Moynihan Report)](https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Moynihan%27s%20The%20Negro%20Family.pdf) Chapters 1, 4, and 5.**

Tune in at 8pm CST/9pm EST via [Google Hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/d2lsbGlhbXMucmViZWNjYUBnbWFpbC5jb20.bqtascc21grhvsndib903e67jk?authuser=0). *Questions TBD*

**Questions to lead discussion:**

1. did the Moynihan report differ from what you expected?
2. thinking about current [debates about the fairness of big data]( https://medium.com/@hannawallach/big-data-machine-learning-and-the-social-sciences-927a8e20460d), what parallels do you see between current arguments and Moynihan's work?
3. many commentators, in decrying big data, point to personal stories and qualitative research. To what extent does Moynihan use this kind of research, and do you think it avoids the unfairness big data is criticized for?
