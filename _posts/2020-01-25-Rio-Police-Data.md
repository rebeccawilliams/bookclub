Let's read a dataset, from Ana: 

Here's the data set on [drug+homicide+attempted-homicide reports](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JY8-HVAQ6gbGIG4CGI4OoqwvKmusWjpZ/view?usp=sharing) I just got through the information access request. Haven't really worked on it yet, so excited to have an excuse to do so!

For all things Rio police data related, [ISP Dados](https://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br:4432/) is the place to look. And I bet you can google translate the site. For precinct shape files, [look here](https://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br:4432/Conteudo.html) (CISPs are the smallest units of analysis).

Another cool dataset is this citizen-reported data on gun shootings in [Rio de Janeiro](https://fogocruzado.org.br/) (and Recife, another state capital here in the country). They have an apiâ€¦and they report both if there was anyone injured as a result of the shooting and if there were any policemen involved. 

Fogo Cruzado partnered with a couple of other organizations, including an anonymous citizen-reporting hot line, to create [this map of criminal organizations](https://erickgn.github.io/mapafc/) in town. Militia are generally made up of former police, so here's a hint in case someone wants to look at where most shootings with police involvement are concentrated ðŸ‘€

And a cool complementary dataviz is the [Public Prosecutor's office's Data Initiative](http://apps.mprj.mp.br/sistema/inloco/) where you can cross a bunch of social, economic, public service, public safety and other datasets. I recommend crossing the crossed fire dataset with info on where schools and basic health clinics are located. There's also a dataset on schools where classes where interrupted due to violence.
