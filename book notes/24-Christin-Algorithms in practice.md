The author stresses that journalism is open to all: "fuzzier occupations like journalism that do not
strictly qualify as professions in the sociological sense, because, unlike law or architecture, then
have not established strict barriers to entry" and subsequent mentions.
Does that threat of others' entry change the decision to use web analytics?

The author advocates COMPAS as potentially useful for reducing bias in parole decisions and
electronic case management systems as generally efficiency improving. When do the same analyses
apply to both types of software?
Are web analytics "algorithmic technologies" (or even "technologies"at all)?

PS: one of the scales for COMPAS in Fig. 2 is "recreation and leisure":
"This scale assesses the degree to which the person experiences feelings of boredom, restlessness,
or an inability to maintain interest in a single activity for any length of time."

Why does the author put foot-dragging, gaming the system, and open critique by workers on the same level as
"buffering strategies to minimize the impact of algorithmic tools in their daily work"
