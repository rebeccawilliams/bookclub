# Convivial Reconstruction

## IVAN lLLICH

The symptoms of accelerated crisis are widely recognized. Multiple
attempts have been made to explain them. I believe that this crisis is
rooted in a major twofold experiment which has failed, and I claim
that the resolution of the crisis begins with a recognition of the
failure. For a hundred years we have tried to make machines work for
men and to school men for life in their service. Now it turns out that
machines do not 'work' and that people cannot be schooled for a life
at the service of machines. The hypothesis on which the experiment was
built must now be discarded. The hypothesis was that machines can
replace slaves. The evidence shows that, used for this purpose,
machines enslave men. Neither a dictatorial proletariat nor a leisure
mass can escape the dominion of constantly expanding industrial tools.

The crisis can be solved only if we learn to invert the present deep
structure of tools; if we give people tools that guarantee their right
to work with high, independent efficiency, thus simultaneously
eliminating the need for either slaves or masters and enhancing each
person's range of freedom. People need new tools to work with rather
than tools that 'work' for them. They need technology to make the most
of the energy and imagination each has, rather than more
well-programmed energy slaves.

I believe that society must be reconstructed to enlarge the
contribution of autonomous individuals and primary groups to the total
effectiveness of a new system of production designed to satisfy the
human needs which it also determines. In fact, the institutions of
industrial society do just the opposite. As the power of machines
increases, the role of persons more and more decreases to that of mere
consumers.

Individuals need tools to move and to dwell. They need remedies for
their diseases and means to communicate with one another. People
cannot make all these things for themselves. They depend on being
supplied with objects and services which vary from culture to
culture. Some people depend on the supply of food and others on the
supply of ball bearings.

People need not only to obtain things, they need above all the freedom
to make things among which they can live, to give shape to them
according to their own tastes, and to put them to use in caring for
and about others. Prisoners in rich countries often have access to
more things and services than members of their families, but they have
no say in how things are to be made and cannot decide what to do with
them. Their punishment consists in being deprived of what I shall call
'conviviality.' They are degraded to the status of mere consumers.

I choose the term 'conviviality' to designate the opposite of
industrial productivity. I intend it to mean autonomous and creative
intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their
environment; and this in contrast with the conditioned response of
persons to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made
environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized
in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical
value. I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced
below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can
effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society's members.

Present institutional purposes, which hallow industrial productivity
at the expense of convivial effectiveness, are a major factor in the
amorphousness and meaninglessness that plague contemporary
society. The increasing demand for products has come to define
society's process. I will suggest how this present trend can be
reversed and how modern science and technology can be used to endow
human activity with unprecedented effectiveness. This reversal would
permit the evolution of a life style and of a political system which
give priority to the protection, the maximum use, and the enjoyment of
the one resource that is almost equally distributed among all people:
personal energy under personal control. I will argue that we can no
longer live and work effectively without public controls over tools
and institutions that curtail or negate any person's right to the
creative use of his or her energy. For this purpose we need procedures
to ensure that controls over the tools of society are established and
governed by political process rather than by decisions by experts.

The transition to socialism cannot be effected without an inversion of
our present institutions and the substitution of convivial for
industrial tools. At the same time, the retooling of society will
remain a pious dream unless the ideals of socialist justice prevail. I
believe that the present crisis of our major institutions ought to be
welcomed as a crisis of revolutionary liberation because our present
institutions abridge basic human freedom for the sake of providing
people with more institutional outputs. This world-wide crisis of
world-wide institutions can lead to a new consciousness about the
nature of tools and to majority action for their control. If tools are
not controlled politically, they will be managed in a belated
technocratic response to disaster. Freedom and dignity will continue
to dissolve into an unprecedented enslavement of man to his tools.

As an alternative to technocratic disaster, I propose the vision of a
convivial society. A convivial society would be the result of social
arrangements that guarantee for each member the most ample and free
access to the tools of the community and limit this freedom only in
favor of another member's equal freedom.

At present people tend to relinquish the task of envisaging the future
to a professional elite. They transfer power to politicians who
promise to build up the machinery to deliver this future. They accept
a growing range of power levels in society when inequality is needed
to maintain high outputs. Political institutions themselves become
draft mechanisms to press people into complicity with output
goals. What is right comes to be subordinated to what is good for
institutions. Justice is debased to mean the equal distribution of
institutional wares.

The individual's autonomy is intolerably reduced by a society that
defines the maximum satisfaction of the maximum number as the largest
consumption of industrial goods. Alternate political arrangements
would have the purpose of permitting all people to define the images
of their own future. New politics would aim principally to exclude the
design of artifacts and rules that are obstacles to the exercise of
this personal freedom. Such politics would limit the scope of tools as
demanded by the protection of three values: survival, justice, and
self-defined work. I take these values to be fundamental to any
convivial society, however different one such society might be from
another in practice, institutions, or rationale.

Each of these three values imposes its own limits on tools. The
*conditions for survival* are necessary but not sufficient to ensure
justice; people can survive in prison. The *conditions for the just
distribution* of industrial outputs are necessary, but not sufficient
to promote convivial production. People can be equally enslaved by
their tools. The conditions for *convivial work* are structural
arrangements that make possible the just distribution of unprecedented
power. A postindustrial society must and can be so constructed that no
one person's ability to express him or herself in work will require
as a condition the enforced labor or the enforced learning or the
enforced consumption of another.

In an age of scientific technology, the convivial structure of tools
is a necessity for survival in full justice which is both distributive
and participatory. This is so because science has opened new energy
sources. Competition for inputs must lead to destruction, while their
central control in the hands of a Leviathan would sacrifice equal
control over inputs to the semblance of an equal distribution of
outputs. Rationally designed convivial tools have become the basis for
participatory justice.

But this does not mean that the transition from our present to a
convivial mode of production can be accomplished without serious
threats to the survival of many people. At present the relationship
between people and their tools is suicidally distorted. The survival
of Pakistanis depends on Canadian grain, and the survival of New
Yorkers on world-wide exploitation of natural resources. The birth
pangs of a convivial world society will inevitably be violently
painful for hungry Indians and for helpless New Yorkers. I will later
argue that the transition from the present mode of production, which
is Overwhelmingly industrial, toward conviviality may start
suddenly. But for the sake of the survival of many people it will be
desirable that the transition does not happen all at once. I argue
that survival in justice is possible only at the cost of those
sacrifices implicit in the adoption of a convivial mode of production
and the universal renunciation of unlimited progeny, affluence, and
power on the part of both individuals and groups. This price cannot be
extorted by some despotic Leviathan, nor elicited by social
engineering. People will rediscover the value of joyful sobriety and
liberating austerity only if they relearn to depend on each other
rather than on energy slaves. The price for a convivial society will
be paid only as the result of a political process which reflects and
promotes the society-wide inversion of present industrial
consciousness. This political process will find its concrete
expression not in some taboo, but in a series of temporary agreements
on one or the other concrete limitation of means, constantly adjusted
under the pressure of conflicting insights and interests.

In this volume I want to offer a methodology by which to recognize
means which have turned into ends. My subject is tools and not
intentions. The choice of this subject makes it impossible to
undertake several related, relevant, and tempting tasks because:

1. It would not serve my purpose to describe in detail any fictional
   community of the future. I want to provide guidelines for action,
   not for fantasy. A modern society, bounded for convivial living,
   could generate a new flowering of surprises far beyond anyone's
   imagination and hope. I am not proposing a Utopia, but a procedure
   that provides each community with the choice of its unique social
   arrangements.
2. I do not want to contribute to an engineering manual for the design
   of convivial institutions or tools, nor do I want to engage in a
   sales campaign for what would be obviously a better technology. My
   purpose is to lay down criteria by which the manipulation of people
   for the sake of their tools can be immediately recognized, and thus
   to exclude those artifacts and institutions which inevitably
   extinguish a convivial life style. Paradoxically, a society of
   simple tools that allows men to achieve purposes with energy fully
   under their own control is now difficult to imagine. Our
   imaginations have been industrially deformed to conceive only what
   can be molded into an engineered system of social habits that fit
   the logic of large-scale production. We have almost lost the
   ability to frame in fancy a world in which sound and shared
   reasoning sets limits to everybody's power to interfere with
   anybody's equal power to shape the world.  The present world is
   divided into those who do not have enough and those who have more
   than enough, those who are pushed off the road by cars and those
   who drive them. The have-nots are miserable and the rich anxious to
   get more. A society whose members know what is enough might be
   poor, but its members would be equally free. Men with industrially
   distorted minds cannot grasp the rich texture of personal
   accomplishments within the range of modern though limited
   tools. There is no room in their imaginations for the qualitative
   change that the acceptance of a stable-state industry would mean; a
   society in which members are free from most of the multiple
   restraints of schedules and therapies now imposed for the sake of
   growing tools. Much less do most of our contemporaries experience
   the sober joy of life in this voluntary though relative poverty
   which lies within our grasp.
3. I will focus on the structure of tools, not on the character
   structure of their users. The use of industrial tools stamps in an
   identical way the landscape of cities each having its own history
   and culture. Highways, hospital wards, classrooms, office
   buildings, apartments, and stores look everywhere the
   same. Identical tools also promote the development of the same
   character types. Policemen in patrol cars or accountants at
   computers look and act alike all over the world, while their poor
   cousins using nightstick or pen are different from region to
   region. The progressive homogenization of personalities and
   personal relationships cannot be stemmed without a retooling of
   society. Research on the social character traits that make
   retooling difficult or doubtful is complementary to what I
   propose. But I am not postulating the creation of a new man as a
   condition for a new society, nor am I pretending to know how either
   social character or cultures will change. A pluralism of limited
   tools and of convivial commonweals would of necessity encourage a
   diversity of life styles.
4. It would distract from the core of my argument if I were to deal
   with political strategies or tactics. With the possible exception
   of China under Mao, no present government could restructure society
   along convivial lines. The managers of our major tools-nations,
   corporations, parties, structured movements, professions-hold
   power. This power is vested in the maintenance of the
   growth-oriented structures which they manipulate. These managers
   have the power to make major decisions; they can generate new
   demands for the output of their tools and enforce the creation of
   new social labels to fit them. They can even go so far as to limit
   the output of tools in the interest of maximizing benefits. But
   they have no power to reverse the basic structure of the
   institutional arrangements which they manage.

	The major institutions now optimize the output of large tools for
    lifeless people. Their inversion implies institutions that would
    foster the use of individually accessible tools to support the
    meaningful and responsible deeds of fully awake people. Turning
    basic institutions upside down and inside out is what the adoption
    of a convivial mode of production would require. Such an inversion
    of society is beyond the managers of present institutions.

	Today's managers form a new class of men, selected for their
    character, competence, and interest-which enable them to both
    expand the productive society and promote the further operant
    conditioning of their clients. They hold and manage power no
    matter who lives in the illusion that he owns the tools. This
    class of power-holders must be eliminated, but this cannot be done
    by mass slaughter or replacement. The new elite would only claim
    more legitimacy in the manipulation of the inherited structured
    power. Management can be done away with only by eliminating the
    machinery that makes it necessary and, therefore, the demands for
    output that give it sway. In a convivial society there is little
    need for replacing the chairman of the board.

	In a society in which power-both political and physical-is bounded
    and spread by political decision there is place not only for a new
    flowering of products and characters, but also for a variety in
    forms of governance. Certainly, new tools would provide new
    options. Convivial tools rule out certain levels of power,
    compulsion, and programming, which are precisely those features
    that now tend to make all governments look more or less alike. But
    the adoption of a convivial mode of production does not of itself
    mean that one specific form of government would be more fitting
    than another, nor does it rule out a world federation, or
    agreements between nation-states, or communes, or many of the most
    traditional forms of governance. I restrict myself to the
    description of basic structural criteria within which the
    retooling of society can be achieved.
5. A methodology by which to recognize when corporate tools become
   destructive of society itself requires the recognition of the value
   of distributory and participatory justice. I believe that my
   succinct statement will be sufficient to identify necessary
   restraints on tools, but it will also preclude that in this essay I
   reach any conclusion about a desirable degree of subordination of
   means to ends.
6. The economics applicable to a postindustrial and convivial society
   can neither be ignored nor taken for granted. In a society that
   accepts politically defined limits on all types of industrial
   growth, many accepted terms will have to be redefined, but it is
   certain that in such a society inequality will not be excluded. In
   fact, each individual's power to make effective changes would be
   greater than in preindustrial or in industrial times. Though they
   would be bounded, common tools would be incomparably more efficient
   than primitive, and more widely distributed than industrial,
   devices. Their products would accrue more to some than to
   others. The task of keeping net transfer of power within bounds
   requires the use of traditional as well as new economic devices. It
   will be argued that the limitation of tools cannot be effected
   before a corresponding new economic theory has been elaborated and
   has become operational. This is correct. I do propose that we use a
   dimensional analysis to obtain information about the major
   variables which can upset the balance of life, and that we rely on
   political process to identify the significant dimensions which man
   can control. I therefore propose an approach to the relationship
   between man's ends and his means in which the key units of
   economics come to signify a dimensionless set of factors. Economics
   useful for the inversion of our present institutional structure
   starts out from politically defined limiting criteria. It is on
   these negative design criteria for technological devices that I
   want to focus attention.

A methodology, by which to recognize the public perversion of tools
into purposes, encounters resistance on the part of people who are
used to measuring what is good in terms of dollars. Plato knew that
the bad statesman is he who believes that the art of measurement is
universal, and who jumbles together what is greater or smaller and
what is more fit to the purpose. Our present attitudes toward
production have been formed over the centuries. Increasingly,
institutions have not only shaped our demands but also in the most
literal sense our logic, or sense of proportion. Having come to demand
what institutions can produce, we soon believe that we cannot do
without it.

The invention of education is an example of what I mean. We often
forget that education acquired its present sense only recently. It was
unknown before the Reformation, except as that part of early
upbringing which is common to piglets, ducks, and men. It was clearly
distinguished from the instruction needed by the young, and from the
study in which some engaged later on in life and for which a teacher
was needed. Voltaire still called it a presumptuous neologism, used
only by pretentious schoolmasters.

The endeavor to put all men through successive stages of enlightenment
is rooted deeply in alchemy, the Great Art of the waning Middle
Ages. John Amos Comenius, a Moravian bishop of the seventeenth
century, a self-styled pansophist and pedagogue, is rightly considered
one of the founders of the modern school. He was among the first to
propose seven or twelve grades of compulsory learning. In his <i>Magna
Didactica</i> he described schools as devices to 'teach everybody
everything' and outlined a blueprint for the assembly-line production
of knowledge, which according to his method would make education
cheaper and better and make growth into full humanity possible for
all. But Comenius was not only an early theoretician of mass
production, he was an alchemist who adapted the technical language of
his craft to describe the art of rearing children. The alchemist
sought to refine base elements by graduating their spirits through
twelve stages of successive enlightenment, so that for their own and
all the world's benefit they might be transformed into gold. Of
course, alchemists failed no matter how often they tried, but each
time their 'science' yielded new reasons for their failure, and they
tried again.

The industrial mode of production was first fully rationalized in the
manufacture of a new invisible commodity, called 'education.' Pedagogy
opened a new chapter in the history of the <i>Ars Magna</i>. Education
became the search for an alchemic process that would bring forth a new
type of man who would fit into an environment created by scientific
magic. But no matter how much each generation spent on its schools, it
always turned out that the majority of people were certified as unfit
for higher grades of enlightenment and had to be discarded as
unprepared for the good life in a man-made world.

Not only has the redefinition of learning as schooling made schools
seem necessary, it has also compounded the poverty of the unschooled
with discrimination against the uneducated. People who have climbed up
the ladder of schooling know where they dropped out and how uneducated
they are. Once they accept the authority of an agency to define and
measure their level of knowledge, they easily go on to accept the
authority of other agencies to define for them their level of
appropriate health or mobility. It is difficult for them to identify
the structural corruption of our major institutions. Just as they come
to believe in the value of the 'knowledge stock' they acquired in
school, so they come to believe that higher speeds save time and that
income levels define well-being or, as an alternative, that the
production of more services rather than more goods increases the
quality of life.

The commodity called 'education' and the institution called 'school'
make each other necessary. The circle can be broken only by a widely
shared insight that the institution has come to define the
purpose. Values abstractly stated are reduced to mechanical processes
that enslave men. This serfdom can be broken only by the joyful
self-recognition of the fool who assumes personal responsibility for
his folly.

The institutional definition of values has made it difficult to focus
our attention on the deep structure of social means. It is hard to
imagine that the division of sciences, of labor, and of professions
has gone too far. It is difficult to conceive of higher social
effectiveness with lower industrial efficiency. To recognize the
nature of desirable limits to specialization and output, we must focus
our attention on the industrially determined shape of our
expectations. Only then can we recognize that the emergence of a
convivial and pluralist mode of production will follow the limitation
of industrial institutions.

In the past, convivial life for some inevitably demanded the servitude
of others. Labor efficiency was low before the steel ax, the pump, the
bicycle, and the nylon fishing line. Between the High Middle Ages and
the Enlightenment, the alchemic dream misled many otherwise authentic
Western humanists. The illusion prevailed that the machine was a
laboratory-made homunculus, and that it could do our labor instead of
slaves. It is now time to correct this mistake and shake off the
illusion that men are born to be slaveholders and that the only thing
wrong in the past was that not all men could be equally so. By
reducing our expectations of machines, however, we must guard against
falling into the equally damaging rejection of all machines as if they
were works of the devil.

A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the
most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by
others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent
that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a
certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and
impotence. I use the term 'tool' broadly enough to include not only
simple hardware such as drills, pots, syringes, brooms, building
elements, or motors, and not just large machines like cars or power
stations; I also include among tools productive institutions such as
factories that produce tangible commodities like corn flakes or
electric current, and productive systems for intangible commodities
such as those which produce 'education,' 'health,' 'knowledge,' or
'decisions.' I use this term because it allows me to subsume into one
category all rationally designed devices, be they artifacts or rules,
codes or operators, and to distinguish all these planned and
engineered instrumentalities from other things such as basic food or
implements, which in a given culture are not deemed to be subject to
rationalization. School curricula or marriage laws are no less
purposely shaped social devices than road networks.

Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates
himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he
actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon. To the
degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his
meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools, the shape of
the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial tools are those
which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to
enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her
vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them
and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and
expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a convivial
fashion.

<i>Hand tools</i> are those which adapt man's metabolic energy to a
specific task. They can be multipurpose, like some primitive hammers
or good modern pocket knives, or again they can be highly specific in
design such as spindles, looms, or pedal-driven sewing machines, and
dentists' drills. They can also be complex such as a transportation
system built to get the most in mobility out of human energy-for
instance, a bicycle system composed of a series of man-powered
vehicles, such as pushcarts and three-wheel rickshas, with a
corresponding road system equipped with repair stations and perhaps
even covered roadways. Hand tools are mere transducers of the energy
generated by man's extremities and fed by the intake of air and of
nourishment.

<i>Power tools</i> are moved, at least partially, by energy converted
outside the human body. Some of them act as amplifiers of human
energy: the oxen pull the plow, but man works with the oxen-the result
is obtained by pooling the powers of beast and man. Power saws and
motor pulleys are used in the same fashion. On the other hand, the
energy used to steer a jet plane has ceased to be a significant
fraction of its power output. The pilot is reduced to a mere operator
guided by data which a computer digests for him. The machine needs him
for lack of a better computer; or he is in the cockpit because the
social control of unions over airplanes imposes his presence.

Tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily
used, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the
accomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user. The use of such tools
by one person does not restrain another from using them equally. They
do not require previous certification of the user. Their existence
does not impose any obligation to use them. They allow the user to
express his meaning in action.

Some institutions are structurally convivial tools. The telephone is
an example. Anybody can dial the person of his choice if he can afford
a coin. If untiring computers keep the lines occupied and thereby
restrict the number of personal conversations, this is a misuse by the
company of a license given so that persons can speak. The telephone
lets anybody say what he wants to the person of his choice; he can
conduct business, express love, or pick a quarrel. It is impossible
for bureaucrats to define what people say to each other on the phone,
even though they can interfere with-or protect-the privacy of their
exchange.

Most hand tools lend themselves to convivial use unless they are
artificially restricted through some institutional arrangements. They
can be restricted by becoming the monopoly of one profession, as
happens with dentist drills through the requirement of a license and
with libraries or laboratories by placing them within schools. Also,
tools can be purposely limited when simple pliers and screwdrivers are
insufficient to repair modern cars. This institutional monopoly or
manipulation usually constitutes an abuse and changes the nature of
the tool as little as the nature of the knife is changed by its abuse
for murder.

In principle the distinction between convivial and manipulatory tools
is independent of the level of technology of the tool. What has been
said of the telephone could be repeated point by point for the mails
or for a typical Mexican market. Each is an institutional arrangement
that maximizes liberty, even though in a broader context it can be
abused for purposes of manipulation and control. The telephone is the
result of advanced engineering; the mails require in principle little
technology and considerable organization and scheduling; the Mexican
market runs with minimum planning along customary patterns.

Any institution that moves toward its second watershed tends to become
highly manipulative. For instance, it costs more to make teaching
possible than to teach. The cost of roles exceeds the cost of
production. Increasingly, components intended for the accomplishment
of institutional purposes are redesigned so that they cannot be used
independently. People without cars have no access to planes) and
people without plane tickets have no access to convention
hotels. Alternate tools which are fit to accomplish the same purposes
with fewer claims are pushed off the market. For instance, civilized
correspondence becomes a lost art. During the last several years this
barring of alternatives has usually coincided with the increased power
of the tool and the development of more complex tool systems.

It is possible that not every means of desirable production in a
postindustrial society would fit the criteria of conviviality. It is
probable that even in an overwhelmingly convivial world some
communities would choose greater affluence at the cost of some
restrictions on creativity. It is almost certain that in a period of
transition from the present to the future mode of production in
certain countries electricity would not commonly be produced in the
backyard. It is also true that trains must run on tracks and stop on
schedule at a limited number of points. Oceangoing vessels are built
for one purpose; if they were sailing clippers, they might be even
more specialized for one route than are present tankers. Telephone
systems are highly determined for the transmission of messages of a
certain band width and must be centrally administered even if they are
limited to the service of only one area. It is a mistake to believe
that all large tools and all centralized production would have to be
excluded from a convivial society. It would equally be a mistake to
demand that for the sake of conviviality the distribution of
industrial goods and services be reduced to the minimum consistent
with survival in order to protect the maximum equal right to
self-determined participation. Different balances between distributive
justice and participatory justice can prevail in societies equally
striving for post-industrial conviviality, depending on the history,
political ideals, and physical resources of a community.

What is fundamental to a convivial society is not the total absence of
manipulative institutions and addictive goods and services, but the
balance between those tools which create the specific demands they are
specialized to satisfy and those complementary, enabling tools which
foster self-realization. The first set of tools produces according to
abstract plans for men in general; the other set enhances the ability
of people to pursue their own goals in their unique way.

The criteria by which anticonvivial or manipulative tools are
recognized cannot be used to exclude every tool that meets them. These
criteria, however, can be applied as guidelines for structuring the
totality of tools by which a society desires to define the style and
level of its conviviality. A convivial society does not exclude all
schools. It does exclude a school system which has been perverted into
a compulsory tool, denying privileges to the dropout. A convivial
society does not exclude some high-speed intercity transport, as long
as its layout does not in fact impose equally high speeds on all other
routes. Not even television must be ruled out-although it permits very
few programmers and speakers to define what their viewers may see-as
long as the over-all structure of society does not favor the
degradation of everyone into a compulsory voyeur. The criteria of
conviviality are to be considered as guidelines to the continuous
process by which a society's members defend their liberty, and not as
a set of prescriptions which can be mechanically applied.

At present the reverse guideline prevails, even in societies where the
producer is told that he is in the saddle. The socialist planner
competes with the free-market advocate in claiming that a society run
on his principles is more productive. In 1931 Stalin translated
'control over the means of production' to mean the increase of
productivity by new methods used to control the producer. In the midst
of the U.S. Depression he launched Russia on an industrial race. Since
then a socialist policy has been considered one which serves the
industrially organized productivity of a socialist country. Stalin's
reinterpretation of Marxism has since then served as a form of
blackmail against socialists and the left. It remains to be seen if
after Mao's death China will also trade productive conviviality for
institutional productivity. The Stalinist interpretation of socialism
has made it possible for socialists and capitalists alike to agree on
how to measure the level of development a society has
achieved. Societies in which most people depend for most of their
goods and services on the personal whim, kindness, or skill of another
are called 'underdeveloped,' while those in which living has been
transformed into a process of ordering from an all-encompassing store
catalogue are called 'advanced.' Stalinism makes it possible to
interpret as revolutionary whatever increases the amount of schooling,
expands the road systems, or increases the productivity of extraction
and manufacture. To be revolutionary has come to mean either to
champion the nation that lags in production and to make its members
keenly aware of the lag, or to inflame the frantic and frustrated
attempts of underconsuming minorities in rich countries to catch up.

Every aspect of industrial societies has become part of a larval
system for escalating production and increasing the demand necessary
to justify the total social cost. For this reason, criticism of bad
management, official dishonesty, insufficient research, or
technological lag distracts public attention from the one issue that
counts: careful analysis of the basic structure of tools as means. It
is equally distracting to suggest that the present frustration is
primarily due to the private ownership of the means of production, and
that the public ownership of these same factories under the tutelage
of a planning board could protect the interest of the majority and
lead society to an equally shared abundance. As long as Ford Motor
Company can be condemned simply because it makes Ford rich, the
illusion is bolstered that the same factory could make the public
rich. As long as people believe that the public can profit from cars,
they will not condemn Ford for making cars. The issue at hand is not
the juridical ownership of tools, but rather the discovery of the
characteristic of some tools which make it impossible for anybody to
'own' them. The concept of ownership cannot be applied to a tool that
cannot be controlled.

The issue at hand, therefore, is what tools can be controlled in the
public interest. Only secondarily does the question arise whether
private control of a potentially useful tool is in the public
interest.

Certain tools are destructive no matter who owns them, whether it be
the Mafia, stockholders, a foreign company, the state, or even a
workers' commune. Networks of multilane highways, long. range,
wide-band-width transmitters, strip mines, or compulsory school
systems are such tools. Destructive tools must inevitably increase
regimentation, dependence, exploitation, or impotence, and rob not
only the rich but also the poor of conviviality, which is the primary
treasure in many so-called 'underdeveloped' areas.

It has become difficult for contemporary man to imagine development
and modernization in terms of lower rather than higher energy
use. High technology has been mistakenly identified with powerful
intervention in physical, psychological, and social processes. The
illusion that a high culture is one that uses the highest possible
quantities of energy must be overcome if we are to get tools into
focus. In classical societies power sources were very equally
distributed. Each man was born with the potential to use most of the
power he would need in a lifetime if his organism was properly
maintained. Control over larger amounts of physical energy was the
result of psychic manipulation or of political domination.

Men did not need power tools to build the Mexican pyramids of
Teotihuacán or the Philippine rice terraces of Ibagué. Their muscles
provided the force to raise St. Peter's and to dig the channels of
Angkor Vat. Runners carried the messages between Caesar's generals and
between village chiefs and Inca planners. Hands and feet moved the
spindle and the loom, the pottery wheel and the saw. Human metabolism
provided the energy that powered classical agriculture, manufacture,
and war. Individual skills were the controls that shaped animal energy
into socially defined work. The energy that rulers could control was
the sum of the performance their subjects voluntarily or involuntarily
conceded.

I do not claim that human metabolism provided all useful power, but I
do claim that in most cultures it was the main source of power. Men
knew how to harness some of the forces of the environment. They
steered barges down the Nile: they gentled beasts to draw the plow;
they caught the wind in their sails: they became experts in the
construction of simple machines which combined the power of men and of
rain and of gravity. They also tamed fire in the forge and the
kitchen, but the total output of these sources remained
secondary. Even Mongols who lived on their mounts provided more energy
with their muscles than with their horsepower. All the energy tapped
from the environment to build Athens and Florence did not contribute
as much controlled power to these classical societies as did their
men. Only when man lit fires to turn cities into ruins or jungles into
swiddens did he release—but certainly not control—energies that
overwhelmed the power of the people who used them.

The amount of physical power available to old societies can be
estimated. It can be expressed in multiples of the average man's
working time and metabolic energy. lie can burn 2,500 calories a day,
four-fifths of them just to stay alive. They go into making his heart
beat and his brain pulse. The remainder can be externalized, but this
does not mean that all of it can be transformed into work. A large
portion of the lifetime capacity of a man to act on his physical and
social environment is burnt running around while he grows up. More is
spent for chores that lie beyond his personal choice-but also beyond
other men's reach. He consumes energy in getting tip, in preparing
food, in seeking protection from the cold, or in avoiding the
slavedriver's whip. If man is deprived of the use of this power, hue
becomes useless for work. Society can give shape to these personal
activities, but it cannot appropriate the energy used on them for
other tasks. Custom, language, and law can determine the form of the
slave's pottery, but the master cannot take the last pots or the roof
away from his slaves, not if he wants them to go on slaving for him. A
small energy parcel from each man was the major source of physical
power with which temples were built, mountains were moved, cloth was
woven, wars were waged, and kings were carried around or amused.

Power was limited. It was proportional to the population. Its major
source was the muscles of individual men. Its efficient use depended
on the stage of development which hand tools had reached and the
distribution of necessary tools throughout the population. Tools all
matched the impedance of manpower to the task. Except by redirecting
the forces of gravity and wind they did not and could not act as
amplifiers of this power. To control more power than others in his
society, a man had to lord it over his fellows. If a ruler could draw
power from sources other than men, his control over this power still
depended on his control over men. Each pair of oxen required a man to
lead them. Even the forge needed a boy to blow into the
fire. Political control co incided with the control over physical
power, and the control of power depended entirely on authority.

Equal power and equal direct control of power were both features of
preindustrial societies, but this did not guarantee an equal autonomy
in the exercise of this control. On a very primi tive level the
physical predominance of one person made him into the lord of
others. A slight advantage in organization or weaponry made one people
the master of another. The appropria tion of resources and tools
created the basis of class societies and fostered the rituals and
myths that shaped men to fit into the class to which they were
assigned.

In a preindustrial society political control could extend only over
the excess power that people could produce. As soon as a population
became efficient enough to produce more power than was required to
maintain it, people could be deprived of control over this
energy. They could be compelled to cede their power to the decisions
of others. They could be either taxed or enslaved. Part of what they
produced on their own could be taken from them, or they could be put
to work for the king or the village. Ideology, economic structure, and
life style tended to favor this concentration of excess energy under
the control of a few.

The degree to which this concentration of control polarized social
benefits varied from one culture to another. At best it improved the
range within which most members of society could employ their
remaining energies. High peasant cultures offer good examples. While
all shared in the tasks of defending their land from enemies or
floods, each was also better dressed, housed, and fed. At worst, the
concentration of decisions over power led to the establishment of
empires which were expanded by merce naries and fed from plantations
worked by slaves.

The total energy available to society increased rapidly toward the end
of the Iron Age, that is, between the time of Agrippa and the time of
Watt. Most of the radical technical mutations that came into existence
before the scientific discoveries in the field of electricity in fact
came about early in the Middle Ages. Because they used windpower far
more effectively than any previous in vention, three-masted sailing
ships made world-wide transporta tion possible. Speedy transportation
with regular deliveries was made possible by the building of canals in
Europe, a millen nium after the same discovery was implemented in
Southeast Asia. A vastly increased application of nonhuman energy to
in dustries like brewing, dyeing, pottery-making, brick-making,
sugar-refining, salt manufacture, and transportation went parallel
with the construction of vastly improved water wheels and wind mills.

From the High Middle Ages to the late Renaissance, new social tools
developed that ensured the protection of the worker's self image and
dignity, although he was now sometimes dwarfed by the size of
machines. The guild system did indeed give the worker a new claim to
the monopoly over tools specific to his trade. But the mill had not
yet grown out of proportion to the miller. His monopoly over
grain-processing protected the guildsman, pro vided him with extra
holidays, and still maximized the services that he could render to his
town. Guilds were neither unions nor professional associations.

Lewis Mumford in his <i>The Myth of the Machine: The Pentagon of
Power</i> points out that one particular enterprise, namely mining,

> set the pattern for later modes of mechanizadon by its callous
> disregard for human factors, by its indifference to the pollution
> and destruction of the neighboring environment, by its concentration

This new attitude toward gainful activity is well reflected in the
introduction of a new term to designate it. <i>Tripaliare</i> meant to
torture on the <i>trepalium</i>, which was first mentioned in the
sixth century as an instrument of impalement made out of three wooden
sticks. By the twelfth century the word in both French and Spanish
expressed a painful experience to which man is subjected; only in the
sixteenth century did it become possible to use the verb
<i>trabajar</i> interchangeably with <i>laborar</i> and <i>sudar</i>
on the job. Equally significant is what happened in the English
language. Things began to *work*—first medicines (1600) and then
physical tools (1650), even though these were not yet tools driven by
any outside power. The alchemist's dream of making a homunculus in the
test tube slowly took the shape of creating robots to *work* for
man, and to educate men to *work* alongside them. The ideology of
an industrial organization of tools and a capitalist organization of
the economy preceded by many centuries what is usually called the
Industrial Revolution. On Baconian premises Europeans began, according
to Mumford, to save time, shrink space, augment power, multiply goods,
over-throw organic norms and displace real organisms with mechanisms
that stimulated them or vastly magnified some single function they
performed. All these imperatives, which have become the groundwork of
science as technology in our present society, seem axiomatic and
absolute only because they remain unexamined. The same change of mind
appears also in a transfer from ritual regularity to mechanical
regularity with an emphasis on time-keeping, space-measuring,
account-keeping, thus translating concrete objects and complex events
into abstract quantities. According to Mumford, it was this
capitalistic devotion to repetitive order that helped undermine the
unmeasurable personal balance between the workman and his tools.

New power meant a new relation to time. The lending of money against
interest was considered 'against nature' by the Church: money
naturally was a means of exchange to buy necessities, not a capital
that could *work* or bear fruits. During the seventeenth century even
the Church abandoned this view-though reluctantly—to accept the fact
that Christians had become capitalist merchants. Time became like
money: I now can *have* a few hours before lunch; how shall I *spend*
time? . . I am *short* of time so I can't *afford* to *spend* that
much time on a committee; it's not *worth* the time . . . It world be
a *waste* of time; I'd rather *save* an hour.

Scientists began to consider man as a power source. They sought to
measure the maximum daily exertion that might be expected from a man
and compare both his maintenance and his power to those of a
horse. Man was reinvented as a source of mechanical power. Prisoners
condemned to the galleys were not much use most of the time, since
galleys were most of the time in port. Prisoners condemned to the
treadmills produced rotary power to which any of the new machines
could be hooked. Up to the early nineteenth century men in English
prisons actually labored on the treadmills to make machines work.

The new attitude of man to his tools during the Industrial Revolution,
which began as capitalism did in the fifteenth century, finally called
for the invention of new sources of power. The steam engine was a
product of the Industrial Revolution rather than the cause of
it. Power plants soon became mobile, and with the railroad the Iron
Age and the Industrial Revolution came to an end. Industrial ways
became the <i>status quo</i>.

Immense new sources of power were tapped during the twentieth century,
and much of this power became self-governing. Man has now been almost
replaced by machines and reduced to being their operator. Fewer men
are needed as gang workers in the fields: slavery has become
uneconomical. But also fewer men are needed on the assembly line, as
engineers have designed machines to perform the tasks that mass
production and industrialization had created in the centuries before
the steam engine. More power has become available, so more power is
used, The human slaveowner is replaced by the operant conditioning of
men in the mega-machine.

We have all grown up as children of our time, and therefore it is
extremely difficult to envisage a postindustrial yet human type of
'work.' To reduce industrial tools seems equivalent to a return to the
tortured labor of the mine and the factory, or to the labor of the
U.S. farm hand who has to compete with his mechanical neighbor. The
worker who had to dip a heavy tire into a solution of hot sulfur each
time the machine asked for it was literally hooked onto his
apparatus. Agricultural labor also ceased to be what it was for a
slave or a farmer. For the slave it was labor at the service and
behest of a master; for the peasant it was his own work which be could
organize and shape in accordance with the demands of growing plants,
hungry animals, and unpredictable weather. The modern farmhand in the
United States today who is deprived of power tools is under a double
pressure quite different from that of the classical slave: he must
measure up to performance standards set by farm hands elsewhere who
use machines, and he is constantly aware that he is underprivileged,
exploited, and abused because in an age of the megamachine he feels
that he is used like a component. The prospect that moving toward a
convivial society might imply a society with low power tools would
seem to him like a return to the exploitation of manpower by
inefficient industrial machines in the early periods of steam.

I have described three types of institutional arrangements within
which tools can be used. Certain tools can be used effectively within
only one of these arrangements. There are tools which can be used
normally for fully satisfying, imaginative, and independent *work*;
others tend to be used primarily in activities best labeled as *labor*;
and, finally, certain machines can only be *operated*. The same can be
said about physical artifacts and about the set of rules that define
formal institutional arrangements. Cars are machines that call for
highways, and highways pretend to be public utilities while in fact
they are discriminatory devices. Compulsory schools constitute a huge
bureaucratic system; no matter how convivially a teacher tries to
conduct his class, his pupils learn through him to which class they
belong. Cars *operate* on highways as teachers operate in schools. Only in a
very limited sense can what the truck driver and the teacher do be
called labor. Only exceptionally will a teacher feel that his
operations within the school system do not directly interfere with his
work.

The market characteristics of these three types of human activity help
to clarify the distinction among them. Labor can be purchased or sold
in the marketplace. Not work as an activity, but only the result of
convivial work can be marketed. Finally, the right to operate machines
and to obtain the scarce privileges that go with employment must be
earned through the previous consumption of certified treatments, which
take the form of a curriculum of schooling and testing along with
successive jobs.

Tools for a convivial and yet efficient society could not have been
designed at an earlier stage of history. We now can design the
machinery for eliminating slavery without enslaving man to the
machine. Science and technology are not bound to the peculiar notion,
seemingly characteristic of the last 150 years of their application to
production, that new knowledge of nature's laws has to be locked into
increasingly more specialized and highly capitalized preparation of
men to use them. The sciences, which specialized out of philosophy,
have become the rationale for an increasing division of
operations. The division of labor has finally led to the labor-saving
division of tools. New technology is now used to amplify supply
funnels for commodities. Public utilities are turned from facilities
for persons into arenas for the owners of expensive tools. The use of
science and technology constantly supports the industrial mode of
production, and thereby crowds off the scene all tool shops for
independent enterprise. But this is not the necessary result of new
scientific discoveries or of their useful application. It is rather
the result of a total prejudice in favor of the future expansion of an
industrial mode of production. Research teams are organized to remedy
minor inefficiencies that hold up the further growth of a specific
production process. These planned discoveries are then heralded as
costly breakthroughs in the interest of further public
service. Research is now mostly oriented toward industrial
development.

This unqualified identification of scientific advance with the
replacement of human initiative by programmed tools springs from an
ideological prejudice and is not the result of scientific
analysis. Science could be applied for precisely the opposite
purpose. Advanced or 'high' technology could become identified with
labor-sparing, work-intensive decentralized productivity. Natural and
social science can be used for the creation of tools, utilities, and
rules available to everyone, permitting individuals and transient
associations to constantly recreate their mutual relationships and
their environment with unenvisaged freedom and self-expression.

New understanding of nature can now be applied to our tools either for
the purpose of propelling us into a hyperindustrial age of electronic
cybernetics or to help us develop a wide range of truly modern and yet
convivial tools. Limited resources can be used to provide millions of
viewers with the color image of one performer or to provide many
people with free access to the records of their choice. In the first
case, technology will be used for the further promotion of the
specialized worker, be lie a plumber, surgeon, or TV performer. More
and more bureaucrats will study the market, consult their balance
sheets, and decide for more people on more occasions about the range
of products among which they may choose. There will be a further
increase of useful things for useless people. But science can also be
used to simplify tools and to enable the layman to shape his immediate
environment to his taste. The time has come to take the syringe out of
the hand of the doctor, as the pen was taken out of the band of the
scribe during the Reformation in Europe.

Most curable sickness can now be diagnosed and treated by
laymen. People find it so difficult to accept this statement because
the complexity of medical ritual has hidden from them the simplicity
of its basic procedures. It took the example of the barefoot doctor in
China to show how modern practice by simple workers in their spare
time could, in three years, catapult health care in China to levels
unparalleled elsewhere. In most other countries health care by laymen
is considered a crime. A seventeen-year-old friend of mine was
recently tried for having treated some 130 of her high-school
colleagues for VD. She was acquitted on a technicality by the judge
when expert counsel compared her performance with that of the
U.S. Health Service. Nowhere in the U.S.A. can her achievement be
considered 'standard,' because she succeeded in making retests on all
her patients six weeks after their first treatment. Progress *should*
mean growing competence in self-care rather than growing dependence.

The possibilities of lay therapy also run up against our commitment to
'better' health, and have blinded us to the distinction between
curable and incurable sickness. This is a crucial distinction because
as soon as a doctor treats incurable sickness, he perverts his craft
from a means to an end. He becomes a charlatan set on providing
scientific consolation in a ceremony in which the doctor takes on the
patient's struggle against death. The patient becomes the object of
his ministrations instead of a sick subject who can be helped in the
process of healing or dying. Medicine ceases to be a legitimate
profession when it cannot provide each man or his next of kin with the
tool to make this one crucial differential diagnosis for himself.

New opportunities for the progressive expansion of lay therapy and the
parallel progressive reduction of professional medicine are rejected
because life in an industrial society has made us place such
exaggerated value on standard products, uniformity, and certified
quality. Industrialized expectations have blurred the distinction
between personal vocation and standard profession. Of course, any
layman can grow up to become a general healer, but this (hoes not mean
that every layman must be taught how to heal. It simply means that in
a society in which people can and must take care of their neighbors
and do so on their own, some people will excel at using the best
available tools. In a society in which people can once again be born
in their homes and die in their homes and in which there is a place
for cripples and idiots in the street, and where a distinction is made
between plumbing and healing, quite a few people would grow up capable
of assisting others to heal, to suffer, or to die.

Just as with proper social arrangements most people would grow up as
readers without having to be schooled and without having to recreate
the pre-Gutenberg profession of the scribe, so a sufficient number
would grow up competent with medical tools. This would make healing so
plentiful that it would be difficult to turn this competence into a
monopoly or to sell it as a commodity. Deprofessionalization means a
renewed distinction between the freedom of vocation and the occasional
boost sick people derive from the quasi-religious authority of the
certified doctor.

Of course the deprofessionalization of most ordinary medicine could
sometimes substitute a quack for today's impostor, but the threat of
quackery becomes less convincing as professionally caused damage
grows. There just is no substitute for the self-correcting judgment of
the layman in socializing the tools invented or use(l by the
professional. Lifelong familiarity with the specific dangers of a
specific remedy is the best preparation for accepting or rejecting it
in time of crisis.

Take another tool—transportation—as an example. Under President
Cárdenas in the early thirties, Mexico developed a modern system of
transportation. Within a few years about 80 percent of the population
had gained access to the advantages of the automobile. Most important,
villages had been connected by dirt roads or tracks. Heavy, simple,
and tough trucks traveled over them every now and then, moving at
speeds far below twenty miles per hour. People were crowded together
on rows of wooden benches nailed to the floor to make place for
merchandise loaded in the back and on the roof. Over short distances
the vehicle could not compete with people, who had been used to
walking and to carrying their merchandise, but long-distance travel
had become possible for all. instead of a man driving his pig to
market, man and pig could go together in a truck. Any Mexican could
now reach any point in his country in a few days.

Since 1945 the money spent on roads has increased every year. It has
been used to build highways between a few major centers. Fragile cars
now move at high speeds over smooth roads. Large, specialized trucks
connect factories. The old, all-purpose tramp truck has been pushed
back into the mountains or swamps. In most areas either the peasant
must take a bus to go to the market to buy industrially packaged
commodities, or he sells his pig to the trucker in the employ of the
meat merchant. He can no longer go to town with his pig. He pays taxes
for the roads which serve the owners of various specialized monopolies
and does so under the illusion that the benefits will ultimately
spread to him.

In exchange for an occasional ride on an upholstered seat in an
air-conditioned bus, the common man has lost much of the mobility the
old system gave him, without gaining any new freedom. Research done in
two typical large states of Mexico-one dominated by deserts, the other
by mountains and lush growth—confirms this conclusion. Less than one
percent of the population in either state traveled a distance of over
fifteen miles in any one hour during 1970. More appropriate pushcarts
and bicycles, both motorized when needed, would have presented a
technologically much more efficient solution for 99 percent of the
population than the vaunted highway development. Such pushcarts could
have been built and maintained by people trained on the job, and
operated on roadbeds built to Inca standards, yet covered to diminish
drag. The usual rationale given for the investment in standard roads
and cars is that it is a condition for development and that without it
a region cannot be integrated into the world market. Both claims are
true, but can be considered as desirable only if monetary integration
is the goal of development.

During the last few years tire promoters of development have come to
admit that cars, as operated now, are inefficient. This inefficiency
is blamed on the fact that modern vehicles are designed for private
ownership, not for the public good. In fact, modern personnel
transport is inefficient not because an individual capsule rather than
a cabin is the model for the largest number of vehicles, or because
these vehicles are now owned by their drivers. It is inefficient
because of the obsessive identification of higher speed with better
transport. Just as the demand for better health at all costs is a form
of mental sickness, so is the pretense of higher speed.

The railroads reflected the class societies they served simply by
putting different fares on the same speed. But when a society commits
itself to higher speeds, the speedometer becomes an indicator of
social class. Any peasant could accompany Lázaro Cárdenas on
horseback. Today only his personal staff can accompany a modern
governor in his private helicopter. In capitalist countries how often
you can cover great distances is determined by what your can pay. In
socialist countries your velocity depends on the social importance the
bureaucracy attaches to you. In both cases the particular speed at
which you travel puts you into your class and company. Speed is one of
the means by which an efficiency-oriented society is stratified.

Fostered addiction to speed is also a means of social
control. Transportation in its various forms now swallows 23 percent
of the U.S. gross expenditures. The United States may be rich enough
to allocate one-fourth of its energy resources and human time to time
enterprise of getting somewhere. Under Khufu, Egyptians might have
spent that much during a few years to build the Great Pyramid and to
get their ruler to the underworld. Unfortunately, however,
transportation exacts an ever higher percentage of the cash spent in a
given year within many a Latin-American municipality. The road
degrades the subsistence farmer and artisan, integrates the village
into time money economy, and swallows much of the available cash. Pt
is true that modern transportation does incorporate a region into the
world market. It also trains the inhabitants for the consumption of
foreign goods and the acceptance of foreign values. For example,
throughout history Thailand was known for its <i>klongs</i>. These
canals crisscrossed the country; people, rice, and tax collectors all
moved easily along them. Some villages were cut off during the dry
season, but their seasonal rhythm of life turned this periodic
isolation into an occasion for meditation and festivities. A society
that can afford long holidays and fill them with activities is
certainly not poor. During time Past half-decade major <i>klongs</i>
were filled in to build roads. Since bus drivers are paid by the
number of miles they can cover in a day, and since cars are still few,
the Thais for a short while will be able to circulate in their country
at world-record bus speeds. They will pay with the destruction of
waterways that took millennia to build. The economists argue that
busses and trucks pump more money per year through the economy. They
do, but at the cost of depriving most Thais of the independence which
their sleek rice boats once granted each family. Of course, car owners
could never have competed with rice boats unless time World Bank had
financed roads for them and time Thai government had made new laws
that permitted them to profane the <i>klongs</i>.

The building trades are another example of an industry that modern
nation-states impose on their societies, thereby modernizing the
poverty of their citizens. The legal protection and financial support
granted the industry reduces and cancels opportunities for the
otherwise much more efficient self-builder. Quite recently Mexico
launched a major program with the aim of providing all workers with
proper housing. As a first step, new standards were set for the
construction of dwelling units. These standards were intended to
protect the little man who purchases a house from exploitation by the
industry producing it. Paradoxically, these same standards deprived
many more people of the traditional opportunity to house
themselves. The code specifies minimum requirements that a man who
builds his own house in his spare time cannot meet. Besides that, the
real rent for industrially built quarters is more than the total
income of 80 percent of the people. 'Better housing,' then, can be
occupied only by those who are well-off or by those on whom the law
bestows direct rent subsidies.

Once dwellings that fall below industrial standards are defined as
improper, public funds are denied to the overwhelming majority of
people who cannot buy housing but could 'house' themselves. The tax
funds meant to improve the living quarters of the poor are monopolized
for the building of new towns next to the provincial and regional
capitals where government employees, unionized workers, and people
with good connections can live. These are all people who are employed
in the modern sector of the economy, that is, people who *hold*
jobs. They can be easily distinguished from other Mexicans because
they have learned to speak about their <i>trabajo</i> as a noun, while
the unemployed or the occasionally employed or those who live near the
subsistence level do not use the noun form when they go to work.

These people, who *have* work, not only get subsidies for the building
of their homes; the entire public-service sector is rearranged and
developed to serve them. In Mexico City it has been estimated that 10
percent of the people use 50 percent of the household water, and on
tire high plain water is very scarce indeed. The building code has
standards far below those of rich countries, but by prescribing
certain ways in which houses must be built, it creates a rising
scarcity of housing. The pretense of a society to provide ever better
housing is the same kind of abberation we have met in the pretense of
doctors to provide better health and of engineers to provide higher
speeds. The setting of abstract impossible goals turns the means by
which these are t9 be achieved into ends.

What happened in Mexico happened all over Latin America during the
decade of the Alliance for Progress, including Cuba under Castro. It
also happened in Massachusetts. In 1945, 32 percent of all one-family
housing units in Massachusetts were still self-built: either built by
their owners from foundation to roof or constructed under the full
responsibility of the owner. By 1970 the proportion had gone down to
11 percent. Meanwhile, *housing* had been discovered as a major
*problem*. The technological capability to produce tools and materials
that favor self-building had increased in the intervening decades, but
social arrangements—like unions, codes, mortgage rules, and
markets—had turned against this choice.

Most people do not feel at home unless a significant proportion of the
value of their houses is the result of the input of their own
labor. Convivial policies would define what people who want to house
themselves cannot get, and thereby make sure that all can get access
to some minimum of physical space, to water, some basic building
elements, some convivial tools ranging from power drills to mechanized
pushcarts, and, probably, to some limited credit. Such an inversion of
the present policy could give a post-industrial society modern homes
almost as desirable for its members as those which were standard for
the old Mayas and are still the rule in Yucatán.

Our present tools are engineered to deliver professional
energies. Such energies come in quanta. Less than a quantum cannot be
delivered. Less than four years of schooling is worse than none. It
only defines the former pupil as a dropout. This is equally true in
medicine, transportation, and housing, as in agriculture and in the
administration of justice. Mechanical transportation is worthwhile
only at certain speeds. Conflict resolution is effective only when the
issue is of sufficient weight to justify the costs of court
action. The planting of new grains is productive only if the acreage
and capital of the farmer are beyond a certain size. Powerful tools
created to achieve abstractly conceived social goals inevitably
deliver their output in quanta that are beyond the reach of a
majority. What is more, these tools are integrated. Access to key
positions in government or industry is reserved to those who are
certified consumers of high quanta of schooling. They are the
individuals chosen to run the plantation of mutant rubber trees, and
they need a car to rush from meeting to meeting. Productivity demands
the output of packaged quanta of institutionally defined values, and
productive management demands the access of an individual to all these
packages at once.

Professional goal-setting produces goods for an environment produced
by other professions. Life that depends on high speed and apartment
houses makes hospitals inevitable. By definition all these are scarce,
and get even scarcer as they approach the standards set more recently
by an ever-evolving profession; thereby each unit or quantum appearing
on the market frustrates more people than it satisfies.

A just society would be one in which liberty for one person is
constrained only by the demands created by equal liberty for
another. Such a society requires as a precondition an agreement
excluding tools that by their very nature prevent such liberty. This
is true for tools that are fundamentally purely social arrangements,
such as the school system, as well as for tools that are physical
machines. In a convivial society compulsory and open-ended schooling
would have to be excluded for the sake of justice. Age-specific,
compulsory competition on an unending ladder for lifelong privileges
cannot increase equality but must favor those who start earlier, or
who are healthier, or who are better equipped outside the
classroom. Inevitably, it organizes society into many layers of
failure, with each layer inhabited by dropouts schooled to believe
that those who have consumed more education deserve more privilege
because they are more valuable assets to society as a whole. A society
constructed so that education by means of schools is a necessity for
its functioning cannot be a just society. Power tools having certain
structural characteristics are inevitably manipulative and must also
be eliminated for the sake of justice. In a modern society, energy
inputs represent one of the major new liberties. Each man's ability to
produce change depends on his ability to control low-entropy
energy. On this control of energy depends his right to give his
meaning to the physical environment. His ability to act toward the
future lie chooses depends on his control of the energy that gives
shape to that future. Equal freedom in a society that uses large
amounts of environmental energy means equal control over the
transformation of that energy and not just an equal claim to what has
been done with it.

Most of the power tools now in use favor centralization of
control. industrial plants with their highly specialized tools give
neither the worker nor most engineers a choice over what use will be
made of the energy they manage. This is equally true, though less
evident, of the high-powered consumer tools that dominate our
society. Most of them, such as cars and air conditioners, are too
costly to be available on an equal basis outside a few superrich
societies. Others, such as mechanical household devices, are so
specialized in nature that they in no way offer more freedom than much
simpler hand tools. The monopoly of industrial production deprives
even privileged clients of control over what they may get. Few people
get the cars that most people want, and GM designers can only build
vehicles to fit the existing roads.

Nations and multinational corporations have become means for the
spreading empire of international professions. Professional
imperialism triumphs even where political and economic domination has
been broken. Schools everywhere are governed by pedagogues who read
the same books on learning theory and curriculum-planning. In a given
year, schools produce more or less the same model of pupils in every
nation. Nineteen-fifty graduates are as obsolete in Dakar as they are
in Paris. The same iatrogenic sicknesses are produced all over the
world by doctors who administer chloromycin or steroid pills. Every
country tends to select those productive processes which are more
capital-intensive and promise greater cost-benefit ratios, so that the
same kind of technological unemployment is produced everywhere. Basic
needs are defined as those that international professions can
meet. Since the local production of these wares is to the advantage of
highly schooled national elites, a country's doctors, teachers, and
engineers will defend it as an antidote to foreign domination. The
knowledge capitalism of professional imperialism subjugates people
more imperceptibly than and as effectively as international finance or
weaponry.

The principal source of injustice in our epoch is political approval
for the existence of tools that by their very nature restrict to a
very few the liberty to use them in an autonomous way. The pompous
rituals by which each man is given a vote to choose between factions
only cover up the fact that the imperialism of industrial tools is
both arbitrary and growing. Statistics which prove increased outputs
and high per capita consumption of professionally defined quanta only
veil the enormously high invisible costs. People get better education,
better health, better transportation, better entertainment, and often
even better nourishment only if the experts' goals are taken as the
measurement of what “better” means. The possibility of a convivial
society depends therefore on a new consensus about time
destructiveness of imperialism on three levels: the pernicious spread
of one nation beyond its boundaries; the omnipresent influence of
multinational corporations; and the mushrooming of professional
monopolies over production. Politics for convivial reconstruction of
society must especially face imperialism on this third level, where it
takes the form of professionalism. The public owner-ship of resources
and of the means of production, arid public control over the market
and over net transfers of power, must be complemented by a public
determination of the tolerable basic structure of modern tools. This
means that politics in a postindustrial society must be mainly
concerned with the development of design criteria for tools rather
than as now with the choice of production goals. These politics would
mean a structural inversion of the institutions now providing and
defining new manmade essentials.

To invert politics, it will not be enough to show that a convivial
life style is possible, or even to demonstrate that it is more
attractive than life in a society ruled by industrial productivity. We
cannot rest with the claim that this inversion would bring society
closer to meeting the goals now stated as those of our major
in-stitutions. It is not even enough to show that a just or socially
equal order can become a reality only through a convivial
reconstruction of tools and the consequent redefinition of ownership
and power. We need a way to recognize that the inversion of present
political purpose is necessary for the survival of all people.

Most people have staked their self-images in the present structure and
are unwilling to lose their ground. They have found security in one of
the several ideologies that support further industrialization. They
feel compelled to push the illusion of progress on which they are
hooked. They long for and expect increase(h satisfaction, with less
input of human energy and with more division of competence. They value
handicraft and personal care as luxuries, but the ideal of a more
labor-intensive, yet modern, production process seems to them quixotic
and anachronistic.

It seems absurd to prepare politicians who have pledged themselves to
increased outputs and better distribution of goods and services among
their constituents for the day when a majority of voters will choose
limits for all rather than promises of equal consumption. It appears
equally hopeless to expect inverse insight from humanitarian liberals
who have come to feel that feeding the starving millions is their
vocation. They forget that people *eat*, amid that people die when they
are *fed*. These self-appointed keepers of their brothers make other
people's survival depend on their own growing efficiency. By shifting
from the production of guns to the production of grains they reduce
their sense of guilt amid increase their sense of power. They are
blind to the convergence of population growth and the failure of the
green revolution, which guarantees that feeding people now will
escalate starvation by 1985. Their hubris distracts them from
understanding that only the renunciation of industrial expansion can
bring food and population into a balance in the so-called backward
countries. The attempt to feed people and to control their increase
are two mutually reinforcing, and very dangerous, illusions. Nor can
economists foresee institutional inversion when for them all
institutions must be evaluated according to the increase in their
planned output and their ability to externalize internal dis-economics
in an unobtrusive way. The terms and frameworks of economics have been
shaped by the ideology of an irresistible institutionalization of
values that overarches otherwise opposed economic creeds.

To translate the theoretical possibility of a postindustrial convivial
life style into a political program for new tools, it must soon be
shown that the prevailing fundamental structure of our present tools
menaces the survival of mankind. It must be shown that this menace is
imminent and that the effects of compulsive efficiency do more damage
than good to most people in our generation. For this purpose we must
identify the range within which our present institutions have become
frustrating, and we must recognize another range within which our
tools become destructive of society as a whole.
